Lab Report - Algorithms

Objective:
To understand and implement algorithms and data structures concepts in a practical setting.

Methodology:
1. Research existing implementations
2. Design the solution architecture
3. Implement the code
4. Test and validate results
5. Document findings

Results:
The implementation successfully demonstrates the core principles of algorithms and data structures.
Performance metrics show that the solution meets all specified requirements.

Analysis:
Through this lab, I learned that algorithms and data structures requires careful consideration of
multiple factors including efficiency, maintainability, and scalability.
